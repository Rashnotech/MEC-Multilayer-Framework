# MEC-Multilayer-Framework
_A lightweight Multilayer Framework for Threat Mitigation on Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)_

<header>
This project was developed as an integrated, scalable, and resource-efficient security frameworks crucial for MEC's unique challenges, emphasizing on the adaptive, multi-layered defence mechanisms that can dynamically respond to threats and ensure robust protection of MEC infrastructures.

## What is MEC?
Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) allows devices in remote locations to process data at the "edge" of the network, either by the device or a local server.

## Why do businesses use MEC?
Businesses use edge computing to improve the response times of their remote devices and to make real-time computing possible in locations where it would not normally be feasible.
